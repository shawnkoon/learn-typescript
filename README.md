## Chapters 📚

0. [About TypeScript](00-about-typescript)
1. [Type Annotations](01-type-annotations)
2. [Class & Interfaces](02-classes-interfaces)

## Run 💻

You can interactively play around with TypeScript files in this repository from the root directory.

1. Install Node/NPM.
    - [Official node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. Install dependencies.

    ```bash
    $ npm install

    ...
    ```

3. Run specific `ts` file.

    ```bash
    $ npx ts-node ./02-classes-interfaces/2_classes.ts

    ...
    ```

    - `npx` let you execute **node modules** without having to install them globally.
    - `ts-node` let you execute **TypeScript** files without having to transpile them.
