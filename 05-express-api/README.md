# Lesson 5 - Express API with TypeScript

This lesson, we are going to be building basic authentication api app using popular serverside framework `express`, and `TypeScript`.

## How to Execute ðŸ’»

1. Navigate back up to root(`/learn-typescript`) folder.

1. Execute following script.

   ```bash

   $ npm run lesson5

   ...

   [tsc] 13:11:44 - Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes.
   [nodemon][nodemon] 1.19.1
   [nodemon][nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
   [nodemon][nodemon] watching: _._
   [nodemon][nodemon] starting `node ./05-express-api/build/index.js`
   [nodemon] Server is listening at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€
   ```

1. Access the application via through `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Takeaways ðŸŽ¯

- Basic Express application.
- Express middleware usage. `ex) body-parser, cookie-session`
- Basic authentication scheme on API.
- Using basic TypeScript with JS modules.
- Like `body-parser` and `express`, type definition files can be wrong at times.

## Misc

There will be an **Advanced** version of this in `lesson 07`. Please check out that application for refactored version of `express` & `typescript`.
