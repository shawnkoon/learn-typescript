# Classes and Interfaces

In this section, we can learn about what `Class` and `Interface` is and how they are used within TypeScript.

Both of these together, developers can write strong reusable code within the project.

## Definitions

Interface - New type which describes set of **property names** and **value types** of an object.

Class - Blueprint of an Object with actual **fields** (values) and **methods** (functions) in them.

## Examples

## Key Points

- Using **Interface**, we can easily define object shapes and be able to use them generically.

- When dealing with **Class**, you can perform `inheritance`, define method/field `modifiers`, and override methods.

- Class/Interface can be very important when we are trying to accomplish re-usable code structure.
